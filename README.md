### Exploring cybersecurity attacks ###
Introduction to the Case study
Business context. You are the cybersecurity expert of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) at the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. In the last month, some cybersecurity events with different durations and patterns have been registered.

Problem statement. You want to identify "what are the most common cybersecurity attacks, the most accessed logical ports, and the visible patterns?"

Analytical context The data to be processed has been obtained by aggregating data provided by a company's technology department, which includes network flow data produced by nine different types of attacks within everyday user activities. Using your data analysis skills, identify what are the most common cybersecurity attacks occurring in the measured time frame, the most accessed logical ports, and the visible patterns of these attacks.

### Conclusion ###
Having plooted and analyzed the data, we were able to identify the pattern of various types of cybersecurity attacks, relating their behavior over time, in duration, and in the distribution of origin and destination ports. The procedure explained here can be extrapolated for all types of cybersecurity studies in which cybersecurity attack data records are kept, which can provide great information on what patterns occur and how to effectively ensure services and servers.
